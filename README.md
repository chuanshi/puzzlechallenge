# A server to emulate the Puzzle Challenge experience

After installing the python packages listed in *requirements.txt*,
run the server with `python main.py`.  The necessary sqlite database
and secret key should be generated automatically.

From here, the only missing components are the pdfs of the puzzles!
You can download them yourself from the archives or email me for a tarball of my copy.
The included solutions, hints, and luggage pieces were manually obtained
from the 2016 contest.
